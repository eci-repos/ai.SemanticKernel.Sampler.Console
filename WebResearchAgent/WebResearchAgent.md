# Web Research Agent

This code implements a Web Research Agent using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel and Ollama's local 
LLM capabilities. The agent performs online research on given topics by leveraging web search 
functionality and summarizing findings through an LLM. Key features include configurable timeout 
settings for HTTP requests, robust error handling, and support for both single-topic research 
and multi-topic comparisons. The implementation demonstrates best practices for integrating 
local LLMs with web APIs, including proper HttpClient management, cancellation support, and 
structured prompt engineering to generate well-formatted research summaries with citations.

The solution addresses common challenges like network timeouts through customizable HttpClient 
configurations while maintaining flexibility for different research scenarios. The agent 
architecture separates concerns between web search operations and LLM processing, with clear 
prompt templates ensuring consistent output formatting. Error handling covers both research 
failures and timeout scenarios, providing graceful degradation when operations exceed time 
limits or encounter network issues. This implementation serves as a practical example of 
building research automation tools using local LLMs with production-ready reliability features.
